# Personal Portfolio

### Technologies
React -- GatsbyJS -- Contentful API -- GraphQL

### Description
This portfolio is built with GatsbyJS, a React-based, static site generator. The data is all provided by a Contentful API, queried by the use of Gatsby's powerful GraphQL server. I had a portfolio before this built with basic HTML and CSS but decided to totally rebuild it in a new, faster, and more future-proof way which allows me to not have to change the raw HTML for every new addition.

### Learning
This project was a great way to learn about using a Headless CMS such as Contentful, making it a lot easier and non-programmer friendly to add and change the content.
